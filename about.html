      <h5 class="how-it-started">How it Started</h5>
      <h6 class="it-started-for">
        It started for Praveen in 2013, when he rescued a kitten with a spinal
        injury. He nursed it at home, but it passed away after a week, leaving
        Praveen to wonder what he could do to help numerous animals like this,
        that suffer in silence. So he started by rescuing injured animals, and
        keeping them at home. Soon, as the number of rescues increased, he
        started looking for temporary shelters to house them. Eventually, the
        news of his rescue got around and he started attending to approximately
        4-5 cases in a day were People Use to tag him in social media Like
        Facebook etc. He took the help of Dr. Girish from Blue Cross and Dr.
        Lohith frm Maruthi pet clinic and started an account in their respective
        clinics, so that injured animals could be attended to, without a delay
        due to the finances. So as the number of rescues went up, so did the
        bill amount in the clinics. But that did not deter Praveen. The word
        spread, and Praveen, who was initially contacted for rescues only around
        South Bangalore, started getting calls for help for cases in Mysore,
        Mandya, Chikmagalur Hosur etc. To manage things better, Praveen started
        a WhatsApp group With Just 6 People And started attending To this cases
        full-time. He had no option but to give up his job, financial help was
        low, but with his family standing behind him, praveen kept doing
        whatever he could for the animals.
